Project: Error Mirror / Divide the Problem Space

Problem
---
Error messages are often underutilized and unshared. Programmers often struggle to share this sort of information.

If you encounter a strange error you often follow these steps:

1. Google it.

2. Hunt down various web pages linked via google - to lighthouse or wherever.

3. Ask a teammate, etc..

4. Debug.
 

Solution
---

Instead of this you should be able to push your error info to a central service and have it tell you about it (if it can). Are other devs elsewhere battling the same problem at the same time? etc.

There could be trending errors. Errors linking back to lighthouse. Error statistics (which library in the entire ruby space has attracted the most errors?!), etc..


Plan
---
We'd need to think about statistics, how to use error info in a social way. There are some very strange errors floating around in the rails space, and thinking of fun ways to classify errors would be great.
